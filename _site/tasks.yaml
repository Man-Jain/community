  description: "We have launched http://community.coala.io/ for our GCI website ,\
    \ and it needs features.\n\nThis task is to privately discuss a missing feature\
    \ with a mentor, and then **after review by a mentor** create a public issue with\
    \ your description.\n\nDo not create an issue before a mentor has approved your\
    \ text.\n\nOther GCI organisations also have GCI websites, so you may find inspiration\
    \ by looking at them. e.g. http://gci17.fossasia.org/ .\n\nHowever, this website\
    \ must be re-usable, which means no coala data in the repository, and no mention\
    \ of coala.  All data must be loaded dynamically from webservices, IGitt, or some\
    \ other 'open data'.\n\nMentors will help you ensure your idea is feasible.\n\n\
    The process for your first issue is very important.\n\n1. Write a comment *privately*\
    \ in your task instance describing the feature.  Your description must be a minimum\
    \ of 500 characters.  Include as much information as you can, including suggestions\
    \ on how to implement the feature.\n2. Submit your task instance for review.\n\
    3. A mentor will review your description, and they will reply with a private comment,\
    \ either telling you to improve your description, or their comment will say \"\
    PUBLISH!\".\n4. If you have been told to PUBLISH, do a quick check of [existing\
    \ issues](https://github.com/coala/community/issues) to prevent duplicates, and\
    \ then create a new issue in the repository if nobody has beaten you to it .\n\
    5. Submit your GCI task for review.\n\nAfter you have completed this task, you\
    \ will be allowed to claim other GCI tasks to create an issue without mentor pre-approval."

  description: "When type-checking a method call, the Checker Framework uses the method\

    \ uses a library, the Checker Framework needs an annotated version of the library.\n\
    \nJava libraries that have already been annotated are at https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/tree/master/checker/lib\n\
    \n# Select a library\nFor this task, you need to select a popular Java library\
    \ from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17x_jKkGquEFq7LBQhS9HGXiG7iIl2AlXoPGfB6N5_bw)\
    \ which you will add annotations to.\n\nCheck the library you are interested in\
    \ has its repository hosted on GitHub, and has tests run by Travis CI.\n\nLook\
    \ for libraries that are small, otherwise this task could take a very long time\
    \ to complete.  Good choices are:\n * commons-lang\n * log4j\n * slf4j\n * some\
    \ part of the JDK that is not already annotated\n\nOnce you have found a library\
    \ you think is suitable, add a comment to your task mentioning the library and\
    \ its GitHub repository, so mentors can check that your choice is suitable.\n\n\
    # Annotate the library\n\n1. Fork the library's GitHub repository,\n2. Enable\
    \ Travis CI on your fork\n3. Adjust its [build system](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#external-tools)\
    \ to run the Checker Framework, and \n4. Add annotations to the library source\
    \ until the type-checker issues no more warnings.\n\nSee the [manual](https://checkerframework.org/manual/),\

    \ for step by step instructions.\n\n**Background** coala unifies code analysis.\
    \ It provides a single simple user and a developer interface, wrapping many popular\
    \ code analysis tools, and provides a native code analysis framework for new tools.\
    \ [Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/42945)\n\nMore documentation on coala can be\
    \ found at http://docs.coala.io.\n\n# Requirements\n\n* This activity is done\
    \ entirely in your own repositories, and does not involve interacting with other\
    \ OSS projects.\n* The task steps use patch and git commands that can be run in\
    \ a bash terminal. Windows users can install [Git-for-Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)\
    \ or [msys2](https://msys2.github.io/) for an equivalent environment. Good Windows\
    \ GUI tools may also be used for this task, such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)\
    \ and [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/).\n\n# Expected Outcome\n\n* You are NOT expected\
    \ to submit any changes to another OSS project in this task.\n* Accepted work\
    \ by mentor following steps [here](\nhttps://github.com/coala/coala/wiki/Google-Code-In-Task-Use-coala-Advanced)\n\
    \n**Note:** There is a separate GCI task for submitting your changes to other\
    \ OSS projects, which you can commence after a coala developer has reviewed and\

  description: "Locate and fix technical bugs contained in translated messages contained\
    \ in a weblate project.\n\n## Aim\n\nThis task aims to help participants gain\
    \ advanced understanding of text markup and translation file formats, as well\
    \ as the open source quality check tools available for these file formats.\n\n\
    DO NOT translate messages. That is not the objective of this task.\n\nDO NOT send\
    \ pull requests.\n\nYour weblate username **MUST** be the same as your GitHub\
    \ username, and your email address in GitHub and weblate **MUST** be identical.\n\
    \n## Find 10 bugs in a translation project\n\nBugs in translated messages include:\n\
    \n-  semantic problems, such as missing grammatical structure, like a missing\
    \ period at the end of a sentence.\n\n-  syntax errors, such as invariant parts\
    \ of the source message that have been translated when they should not be translated.\n\
    \nThere are existing open source tools that find and even fix these problems automatically.\
    \  A linter supported by coala DennisBear is [`dennis`](https://github.com/willkg/dennis).\
    \  Another open source tool is [`translate-toolkit`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translate_Toolkit),\
    \ which is included in most Linux distributions.  \n\nChoose translations projects\
    \ in either:\n\n- https://hosted.weblate.org/ [projects](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/)\n\
    - https://l10n.opensuse.org/ [projects](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/)\n\
    \n### Register your project\n\nTo avoid conflicts, only one participant may work\
    \ on a project at a time.\n\nOnce you have found a project with technical bugs,\
    \ register it as your project on Zulip in the #gci stream under topic `weblate`.\n\
    \n## Fix 10 bugs\n\n1. Fix the translation bugs in weblate\n2. Give _star_ to\
    \ the repo"

    \ (eg. particular technologies, git guidelines etc.)\n* What general perception\
    \ did GCI provide you about Open Source\n* Any difficulty you faced during tasks\
    \ and most importantly how you overcome them.\n\nYou can also include things which\
    \ can help in outreach for coala like :\n* How did you find your way to coala?\n\
    * What do you think about mentor support?\n* How should a newcomer go about exploring\
    \ things after they join coala?\n\nAlso, feel free to write this at any time during\
    \ GCI. You are encouraged to write such blog posts at different time during GCI\
    \ period to give future participants a perspective about different times during\
    \ GCI period.\n\nThis must be original work and must be in your own words. Any\
    \ assets you use must be Creative Commons and attributed accordingly, or be your\
    \ own original work.\n\nFinally add your blog to http://blog.coala.io/ with a\

    \ task](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/6583830645309440/),\n\nThis task involves\
    \ designing a new logo for the coala bot, corobo.\n\nBe creative and make your\
    \ art aesthetically associated with corobo! You must be able to explain how your\
    \ design relates to corobo.  Interacte with corobo on gitter.im and Zulip.  Let\
    \ the bot inspire you!\n\nYou must submit a completely original design of your\
    \ own creation that does not use 3rd party images from the web, unless they are\
    \ licensed under Creative Commons licenses. If you create a design similar to\
    \ something you found on the web, it is considered a derivative work and you should\
    \ give proper attribution (i.e., credit) to that author by name with a link to\
    \ their work. Failure to give credit is plagiarism and can be grounds for dismissal\
    \ from GCI. When in doubt, design something unique. ;)\n\nLogo design tips are\
    \ in abundance around the web such as these [65 tips](http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/pro-guide-logo-design-21221)\
    \ and these [7 tips](http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/logo-design-tips/#9jAYOSkGciqx).\n\
    \nFamiliarity with a graphics design package like Gimp & Inkscape (open source\

    \ task.\n\nUpload your original vector artwork files to either https://www.behance.net/\
    \ or https://www.deviantart.com/ , with the same username as you have used for\
    \ GitHub.  Your uploaded files must be licensed under Creative Commons Sharealike.\

    \ have Atom installed. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:autocomplete-python/autocomplete-python.git`\
    \ and use `apm link autocomplete-python` to link the git repository as installed\
    \ package in Atom. Use `apm test` to run the actual tests (they will fail by default,\
    \ since the APIs been changed and nobody has fixed them).\n\nTests are located\
    \ in `spec` directory with one example, which tests the actual completions.\n\n\
    Things to test, each as a separated task instance:\n* Fix existing test to pass\n\
    * Go to definition command\n* Complete argument command\n* Override method command\n\
    * Show usages command\n* Rename command (possibly with separated files as well)\n\
    * Extra paths for packages config – create a dummy package and make sure that\
    \ that dummy library is included in completions when setting is set\n* Autocomplete\
    \ function parameters config (none, all, required) – test each of them and make\
    \ sure the output is correct\n* Regex to trigger autocompletions config – make\
    \ sure that completions are NOT triggered if it does not match this config (e.g.\
    \ in your test set this config to `([a-zA-Z0-9]*)` and make sure that completions\
    \ are not triggered by `.` (dots))\n* Use fuzzy matcher for completions – make\

  description: "# Introduction\nBeen busy coding like hell? Wanna let some heat off\
    \ with easy points? This task is just for you. To test your level of humor. (Just\
    \ kidding XD)\n\nWho doesn't love funny loading screens? GitMate team has been\
    \ busy working out some of them. Check out the repositories tab on https://gitmate.io\
    \ to watch them live.\n\nHere are some examples..\n\n- Opening pod bay doors...\n\
    - Waiting for the right moment...\n- Downloading the internet...\n- Testing your\
    \ patience...\n- Buying some server space...\n- Hang on a second, I know your\
    \ data is somewhere here...\n- Sending sheep to Mars...\n- Stealing your passwords...\n\
    - Gathering your credit card info...\n- Shovelling coal into our servers...\n\n\
    # Objective\n\nYour task is to add more such sentences. Check our list [here](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2-frontend/blob/master/src/app/spinner/spinner.component.ts#L11).\
    \ Make sure you don't repeat them and you do not post the ones listed above.\n\
    \nOnce you've got ideas, road test your sentences on your friends to see which\
    \ of them are more delightful than others and come up with more ideas together\
    \ with them. Ideally you have a growing list of sentences that you then reduce\
    \ to only the best ones because quality is more important than quantity.\n\nWhen\
    \ you got a short list, **post them on your task instance**. Please **DO NOT**\
    \ post them on GitLab (yet).\n\n# Assessment\n\nOnce the mentor accepts your work,\
    \ you can then send in a pull request to gitmate-2-frontend repository stating\
    \ **only one (best) sentence per student**. Quality is more important than quantity.\n\
    \nCheck the external URL below for the issue."
